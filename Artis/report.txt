29/2-7/3 Choosing how to program microcontroler
Goal: Flash the XIAO Sense with nRF Connect via ZephyrRTOS



The Zephyr OS is based on a small-footprint kernel designed for use on resource-constrained and embedded systems: from simple embedded environmental sensors and LED wearables to sophisticated embedded controllers, smart watches, and IoT wireless applications. (https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/introduction/index.html)
Seeed XIAO nRF52840 is not natively suported. Seeed made library for Arduino IDE, which supports Arduino and Mbed framework, that was implemented through Github to PlatformIO and allows non-problematic impplementation.

The XIAO has library in the Zephyr Github repository, but the PlatformIO does not use most recent version. The version of Zephyr itself is altered in PlatformIO and therefore does not work even after corssreferencing with other boards already implemented in PlatformIO, such as Seeeduino (as a reference for the formfactor) or nRF52840 DK (as a reference for the chip).

The PlatformIO does not have inbuild serial USB communication, which results in inability to reprogram the board through the VS Code and need to go through bootloader first. This poses inconvinience, which can be avoided by use of a Arduino IDE, therefore if route of MBed or Arduino framework is chosen, Arduino IDE should be chosen. If the route of Zephyr is chosen, SDK by nordic semi is the optimal route, because event though it also does not have serial USB, it uses bearbone Zephyr
