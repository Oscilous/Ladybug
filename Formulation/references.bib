   abstract = {Pollination is the vital process for all flowering plants. But, unlike animals, plants cannot move in search of the partner, and they should rely on the help of external forces like wind, water or insects that transfer pollen to other plant for creation of new seeds. In spite of the fact that external environment is capable to provide pollination of plants it is not enough for intensive agricultural production. In this regard there is a need of searching a new more efficient pollination instrument to increase productivity of crops. The article argues that the simulated pollination of agricultural plants by means of nano copter can provide collecting and delivering pollen in the mode of automatic control. A design of nano copter for pollination can be made on the basis of innovative modification of existing model by its reprogramming with regard to its flight controller that is to be fully adapted to computer interface. The robotic system is offered specially for artificial pollination in conditions of greenhouses and minor agricultural enterprises.},

   abstract = {The evolution of energy-efficient ultra-low-power (ULP) parallel processors and the diffusion of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are fueling the advent of autonomous driving nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These sub-10cm robotic platforms are envisioned as next-generation ubiquitous smart-sensors and unobtrusive robotic-helpers. However, the limited computational/memory resources available aboard nano-UAVs introduce the challenge of minimizing and optimizing vision-based CNNs - which to date require error-prone, labor-intensive iterative development flows. This work explores methodologies and software tools to streamline and automate all the deployment of vision-based CNN navigation on a ULP multicore system-on-chip acting as a mission computer on a Crazyflie 2.1 nano-UAV. We focus on the deployment of PULP-Dronet (Palossi et al., 2019), a state-of-the-art CNN for autonomous navigation of nano-UAVs, from the initial training to the final closed-loop evaluation. Compared to the original hand-crafted CNN, our results show a 2\times reduction of memory footprint and a speedup of 1.6\times in inference time while guaranteeing the same prediction accuracy and significantly improving the behavior in the field, achieving: i) obstacle avoidance with a peak braking-speed of 1.65m/s and improving the speed/braking-space ratio of the baseline, ii) free flight in a familiar environment up to 1.96m/s (0.5m/s for the baseline), and iii) lane following on a path featuring a 90deg turn - all while using for computation less than 1.6% of the drone's power budget. To foster new applications and future research, we open-source all the software design in a ready-to-run project compatible with the Crazyflie 2.1.},

   abstract = {Nowadays, there is a growing need for flying drones with diverse capabilities for both civilian and military applications. There is also a significant interest in the development of novel drones which can autonomously fly in different environments and locations and can perform various missions. In the past decade, the broad spectrum of applications of these drones has received most attention which led to the invention of various types of drones with different sizes and weights. In this review paper, we identify a novel classification of flying drones that ranges from unmanned air vehicles to smart dusts at both ends of this spectrum, with their new defined applications. Design and fabrication challenges of micro drones, existing methods for increasing their endurance, and various navigation and control approaches are discussed in details. Limitations of the existing drones, proposed solutions for the next generation of drones, and recommendations are also presented and discussed.},
