# About
Controling the drone sounds better than hardcoding it, so I might as well try to make it. 
# Timeplan:
- 28/2 - 7/3 = Platform decision
- 7/3 - 14/3 = BLE communication
- 14/3 - 21/3 = Control implementation
- 21/3 - 12/4 = Buffer and holiday
- 12/4 - 18/4 = Designing prototype
- 18/4 - 25/4 = Manufacturing prototype
- TBD
