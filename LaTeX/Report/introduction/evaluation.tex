\subsection{Evaluation matrix}

Below is the evaluation matrix, where all the combinations of solutions are graded according to each criterion with a certain importance. The criterions stem from the project goals and constraints. For every combination each grade given to a criterion is multiplied with the importance and then added with the other grades in their respective criterions multiplied with their importance.
