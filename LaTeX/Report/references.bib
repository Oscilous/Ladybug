  abstract  = {Pollination is the vital process for all flowering plants. But, unlike animals, plants cannot move in search of the partner, and they should rely on the help of external forces like wind, water or insects that transfer pollen to other plant for creation of new seeds. In spite of the fact that external environment is capable to provide pollination of plants it is not enough for intensive agricultural production. In this regard there is a need of searching a new more efficient pollination instrument to increase productivity of crops. The article argues that the simulated pollination of agricultural plants by means of nano copter can provide collecting and delivering pollen in the mode of automatic control. A design of nano copter for pollination can be made on the basis of innovative modification of existing model by its reprogramming with regard to its flight controller that is to be fully adapted to computer interface. The robotic system is offered specially for artificial pollination in conditions of greenhouses and minor agricultural enterprises.},

  abstract  = {The evolution of energy-efficient ultra-low-power (ULP) parallel processors and the diffusion of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are fueling the advent of autonomous driving nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These sub-10cm robotic platforms are envisioned as next-generation ubiquitous smart-sensors and unobtrusive robotic-helpers. However, the limited computational/memory resources available aboard nano-UAVs introduce the challenge of minimizing and optimizing vision-based CNNs - which to date require error-prone, labor-intensive iterative development flows. This work explores methodologies and software tools to streamline and automate all the deployment of vision-based CNN navigation on a ULP multicore system-on-chip acting as a mission computer on a Crazyflie 2.1 nano-UAV. We focus on the deployment of PULP-Dronet (Palossi et al., 2019), a state-of-the-art CNN for autonomous navigation of nano-UAVs, from the initial training to the final closed-loop evaluation. Compared to the original hand-crafted CNN, our results show a 2\times reduction of memory footprint and a speedup of 1.6\times in inference time while guaranteeing the same prediction accuracy and significantly improving the behavior in the field, achieving: i) obstacle avoidance with a peak braking-speed of 1.65m/s and improving the speed/braking-space ratio of the baseline, ii) free flight in a familiar environment up to 1.96m/s (0.5m/s for the baseline), and iii) lane following on a path featuring a 90deg turn - all while using for computation less than 1.6% of the drone's power budget. To foster new applications and future research, we open-source all the software design in a ready-to-run project compatible with the Crazyflie 2.1.},

There is also a significant interest in the development of novel drones which can autonomously fly in different environments and locations and can perform various missions. In the past decade, the broad spectrum of applications of these drones has received most attention which led to the invention of various types of drones with different sizes and weights. In this review paper, we identify a novel classification of flying drones that ranges from unmanned air vehicles to smart dusts at both ends of this spectrum, with their new defined applications. Design and fabrication challenges of micro drones, existing methods for increasing their endurance, and various navigation and control approaches are discussed in details. Limitations of the existing drones, proposed solutions for the next generation of drones, and recommendations are also presented and discussed.},

   abstract = {The Fine–Kinney method (Fine in J Saf Res 3:157–166, 1971; Kinney and Wiruth in Practical risk analysis for safety management. Naval Weapons Center, pp 1–20, 1976), which was first introduced as an occupational health and safety risk analysis tool in the 1970s, is a systematic methodology that provides a mathematical formula for calculating the risk that arises due to a specified hazard. In the traditional version of Fine–Kinney as suggested in its original version, a risk score (RS) is calculated as a result of mathematical multiplication of probability (P), exposure (E), and consequence (C) parameters. These calculated risk scores are used to establish priorities for the corrective efforts in order to eliminate risks or reduce their effects to a reasonable level. This simple and useful method is preferred and implemented by small and medium-sized enterprises. In the academic literature, it has been applied for many risk analysis problems, although it includes several drawbacks recently revealed. In this method, no weight assignment is made for each risk parameter. Also, it is hard to assess consequence, exposure, and probability, precisely. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) is a pool of methods used in occupational health and safety risk analysis both by international standard-setting organizations and scholars from the literature. In classical MCDM methods, performance values and weights of decision criteria are known precisely and are specified with crisp numbers. However, many real-world problems contain uncertainties, and the knowledge and judgment of experts cannot be expressed precisely. Fuzzy-based MCDM methods, which are developed to reflect types and degrees of uncertainties better, produce more accurate results compared to classical methods. In this chapter, we first present the basics of Fine–Kinney method, including its implementing procedure, basic terminology, and drawbacks. Then, we provide a state-of-the-art review of Fine–Kinney occupational risk assessment method and its extensions by fuzzy sets. Graphical results obtained from the review are demonstrated to show the current state. Future work suggestions are also included to the chapter to show the possible gaps and possible opportunities.},

An advanced control method, MPC has been widely used and in a wide variety of applications in process control systems, it utilizes an explicit process model to predict the future response of a process and solve an optimal control problem with a finite horizon at each sampling instant. In this paper, Firstly a closed-loop -tank water level system using the Mobile Level process station model 3503 which is built by Lab-Volt (Canada) has been implemented on line in real time mode using the MATLAB environment. Next, linearized the system for simplification in the analysis. Then, a very flexible interface, smart data acquisition card is developed based on Arduino atmega328p microcontroller system which could be used with a very little effort and will be suitable for any similar process. Both MPC and PID control methods have been tried for Level process station, and compared the results in terms of overshoot, settling time, and steady-state error under various operational conditions including time delays, also compared the reaction of the MPC and PID Controllers to the disturbance. The results shows the advantage of MPC for dealing with the system dynamics over PID, also could be designed for faster and more complex system dynamics even in presence of constraints..},

@article{PIDLinear2,
   abstract = {Modern automation systems largely rely on closed loop control, wherein a controller interacts with a controlled process via actions, based on observations. These systems are increasingly complex, yet most deployed controllers are linear Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers. PID controllers perform well on linear and near-linear systems but their simplicity is at odds with the robustness required to reliably control complex processes. Modern machine learning techniques offer a way to extend PID controllers beyond their linear control capabilities by using neural networks. However, such an extension comes at the cost of losing stability guarantees and controller interpretability. In this paper, we examine the utility of extending PID controllers with recurrent neural networks—–namely, General Dynamic Neural Networks (GDNN); we show that GDNN (neural) PID controllers perform well on a range of complex control systems and highlight how they can be a scalable and interpretable option for modern control systems. To do so, we provide an extensive study using four benchmark systems that represent the most common control engineering benchmarks. All control environments are evaluated with and without noise as well as with and without disturbances. The neural PID controller performs better than standard PID control in 15 of 16 tasks and better than model-based control in 13 of 16 tasks. As a second contribution, we address the lack of interpretability that prevents neural networks from being used in real-world control processes. We use bounded-input bounded-output stability analysis to evaluate the parameters suggested by the neural network, making them understandable for engineers. This combination of rigorous evaluation paired with better interpretability is an important step towards the acceptance of neural-network-based control approaches for real-world systems. It is furthermore an important step towards interpretable and safely applied artificial intelligence.},
