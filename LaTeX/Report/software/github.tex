\subsection{GitHub Interaction}
Each semester project has a main focus-point for educational purposes. The main focus-point for SPRO4 is control engineering which covers implementations such as IMU combined with programming and PID for the drone. This means a lot of the project development will be software related.

Working together in a large group for a single deterministic purpose can be cumbersome, so in order to better track progress, a GitHub repository has been made to share files and collaborate more effectively. GitHub requires little to no extra effort to implement and use, and will only require a small change in work culture to use correctly, potentially saving a lot of time.

 The GitHub repository is an easy way to share and keep track of the software development progress, and gives many advantages when working with embedded systems. 

\subsubsection{Advantages of Using GitHub}
GitHub works by having one main code or branch which is shared between everyone. Users can then create their own branches and work on something individually, before it is sent back to the main. This means past revisions of work can be saved and reviewed by everyone, and changes can easily be reverted if a fundamental mistake occurs or is spotted during development. Mistakes in the software are also easier to identify and can be solved without having to change the main program at all. This also means that changes can be made without interfering with other peoples' workflow, giving a clear advantage when working/collaborating on similar problems in the software.\cite{benefitsGithub}
